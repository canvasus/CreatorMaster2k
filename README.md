# CreatorMaster2k

This is a just for fun project where I want to recreate the feel of the Atari platform Creator/Notator sequencer running on a Teensy 4 with peripherals.

Warning: this is very much in work and there will be no "released" versions. Use the code for inspiration mainly.

Parts used:
- Teensy 4.1
- 7" RA8875-based display
- Usb mouse
